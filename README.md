## About Me

Hello! I'm Arneeth and i'm currently diving into the world of **Data Analytics** with a focus on using **Python**. My goal is to build a solid foundation in data analysis, visualization, and predictive modeling, leveraging Python's powerful libraries and tools.

## Learning Objectives

I am working on mastering the following key areas:

1. **Python Programming Basics**  
   - Understanding Python syntax and basic programming concepts.
   - Writing clean and efficient code.

2. **Data Analysis**  
   - Manipulating and analyzing data using libraries like **Pandas** and **NumPy**.
   - Exploring datasets, cleaning data, and performing exploratory data analysis (EDA).

3. **Data Visualization**  
   - Creating insightful and visually appealing charts using **Matplotlib** and **Seaborn**.
   - Developing dashboards and interactive visualizations with **Plotly**.

4. **Statistics & Probability**  
   - Applying statistical methods to understand data distributions and relationships.
   - Using probability theory to inform decision-making.

5. **Machine Learning Fundamentals**  
   - Building predictive models using **scikit-learn**.
   - Understanding key concepts such as regression, classification, and clustering.

6. **SQL for Data Management**  
   - Querying and managing data stored in relational databases.
   - Integrating SQL queries with Python for seamless data analysis.

## Projects

As part of my learning journey, I am working on the following projects:

1. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) Project**  
   - Objective: Analyze a real-world dataset to uncover trends, patterns, and insights.
   - Tools: Pandas, Matplotlib, Seaborn.

2. **Predictive Modeling Project**  
   - Objective: Develop a machine learning model to predict outcomes based on historical data.
   - Tools: scikit-learn, Pandas, NumPy.

3. **Data Visualization Project**  
   - Objective: Create an interactive dashboard that visualizes key metrics and trends.
   - Tools: Plotly, Dash.

## Interests

In addition to my focus on data analytics, I have a keen interest in:

- **Big Data Technologies**: Exploring tools like Hadoop and Spark to handle large datasets.
- **Data Science**: Diving deeper into machine learning and AI to create smarter, data-driven solutions.
- **Data Ethics**: Understanding the ethical implications of data usage and ensuring responsible data handling.

## Resources

Here are some of the resources I am using:

- **Books**: 
  - *Python for Data Analysis* by Wes McKinney
  - *Hands-On Machine Learning with Scikit-Learn, Keras, and TensorFlow* by Aurélien Géron
- **Courses**:
